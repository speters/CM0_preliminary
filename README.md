# CM0_preliminary

This repository contains Raspberry Pi CM0 compute module preliminary datasheets and KiCAD design files.

They are considered "preliminary" until the advent of proper official docu from Raspberry Pi.

### Sources

### About

PDF documents from the EDAtec site concerning CM0 development kit were translated from Chinese to English with the help of _DeepL_.

The site mentions possible translation errors, so their info supposedly came from some English documentation.

KiCAD symbols, footprints, 3D files are done by myself with the info from the PDF.
